    <h2>Not good Devdas movie public talk</h2>
    <p>Devadas is a 2018 Indian Telugu-language action comedy film produced by C. Ashwini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner and directed by Sriram Adittya. The film stars Nagarjuna Akkineni, Nani, Aakanksha Singh, Rashmika Mandanna and music composed by Mani Sharma. It was released on 27 September 2018.[3] It is dubbed in Hindi as Don Aur Doctor by Zee Studios in November 2019. Devadas certainly has its moments with some cracking humour and solid performances by its two stars. A tad too long, with some avoidable melodrama and a weak climax prove to be troublesome, but it doesn't take it away from a hilarious first half which makes it worth your while. If you're somebody who enjoys Nani's brand of humour - Devadas is a must-watch.</p>
